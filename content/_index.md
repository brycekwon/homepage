I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a **Major in Computer Science** and **Minor in Biology** at the [University of Portland](https://www.up.edu). My interests are primarily in backend development, computer networks, and cybersecurity. Welcome to my corner of the internet!

Currently, I am working part-time as a **Biomedical Researcher** for [Kimball's Research Lab](https://sites.up.edu/krl/) and serving as **Treasurer** for my university's [ACM Club Chapter](https://www.acm.org/).
